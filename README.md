Prototype crypto trading alert app supporting flexible, user-defined strategies.

## Features (v1.0)

- Select Moving Average (MA) indicators with multi-MA selection UI
- Prebuilt alert conditions like MA crossovers
- Timeframe and crypto (BTC, ETH) support
- Simple, fun, and unorthodox design aesthetic

---

## Planned Improvements

This is just the MVP — there’s much more to come:

- Expanding indicator choices beyond Moving Averages
- More complex, user-defined alert logic (with optional custom code)
- Full-fledged web deployment with improved UI/UX
- Support for multiple cryptocurrencies and timeframes
- Integration with real-time data sources and alerts

---

## Deployment

The app is built with Streamlit and can be run locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
